# Game is all about optimizing the hand you have

## Play the hand you are dealt not what you “want to do”

## Try to use a mana every single turn

# Fight as many monsters as you can as you move across the board

## Moving without fighting or using influence will cut efficiency

# Plan out attacks before commiting to a “face-up” battle

# Pay attention to opponents decks in deciding # of cards to play

# Focus on what scores you points! Killing monsters & FP categories

# Good Luck and Have Fun!
